# 🔐 Hex-Cypher

**Hex-Cypher** is a simple and customizable text encryption tool that uses hexadecimal transformation and iteration-based logic. You can encode any text into a hex pattern and decode it back using the same number of iterations.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Multi-iteration encryption
- 🔄 Reversible (encode/decode)
- 🔤 ASCII to Hex & Hex to ASCII transformation
- 🧪 Easy to extend with more complex logic

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each character of the input string is converted into its hexadecimal equivalent.
- The process is repeated `n` times to make the encoded string more obfuscated.
- Decoding simply reverses this process `n` times.
